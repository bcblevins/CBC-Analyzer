# CBC-Analyzer

This program is designed to take a series of blood values from the user, compare them to reference ranges, and output the results in a table.

Also included is a demo mode where blood values are randomly generated.

## Current Capabilities

- Take blood values and patient name as input 
- Generate random values for demonstration purposes
- Compare values to reference ranges for dogs
- Log non-generated blood analyses
- Search log for previous tests by name or date

## Potential Future Capabilities

- Provide support for multiple species
- Provide support for a greater number of CBC parameters
- Recall most recent test results
- Reference ranges are based on healthy patients in the local population. Ask user if blood to be analyzed is from an apparently healthy patient. Make a flag to attach to healthy patient results in the text file log.
